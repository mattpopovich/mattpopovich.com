description: My notes and research on floating the Upper Colorado River

## Intro
I love floating rivers. I want to someday float the Colorado River. This is where I'm going to keep my notes.

## Floating the Upper Colorado River
> "[Gently flowing through non-intimidating whitewater](https://www.coloradodirectory.com/rafting/colorado.html)"

This is near [Kremmling, CO](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3pkzXU7WKAzZiZPK6). 1hr north of Vail, 2hr west of Denver.

## Additional Information
* A permit is not required to float the Upper Colorado River. [Source](https://www.riversports.com/blogs/4crs/5-river-trips-that-dont-require-a-permit)
* Flow rate recommendations [source](https://skiboulder.com/pages/where-to-go-tubing-upper-colorado-river):
* The Upper Colorado is almost never too low to float
    * May and June could be too high
    * May - September is best
* 300 - 800cfs = mellow float, Radium to Dotsero are all good
* 800 - 1500cfs = potentially exciting float, Lyons Gulch to Dotsero is best
* 1500cfs - 5000cfs = exciting float, Lyons Gulch to Dotsero is best
* \>5000cfs = not recommended to float except for Dotsero to Blair Ranch
* [Flow rate at Dotsero](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/09070500/#parameterCode=00060&period=P7D)
* I haven't found concrete information on if a PDF (personal flotation device) is required.
