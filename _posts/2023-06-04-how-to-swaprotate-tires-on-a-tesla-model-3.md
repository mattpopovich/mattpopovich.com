## Tools Needed
* **Low profile** 3 Ton Jack
  * [$110 Harbor Freight (recommended)](https://www.harborfreight.com/automotive/jacks-jack-stands/floor-jacks/low-profile/3-ton-low-profile-floor-jack-with-rapid-pump-red-56617.html)
  * [$160 Amazon](https://amzn.to/3MHINsA) 
  * How big of a jack do you need? [~3/4 weight of your vehicle](https://www.sgs-engineering.com/help-advice/how-to-buy-the-right-trolley-jack/#:~:text=Because%20a%20jacked%20vehicle%20will,ton%20capacity%20to%20lift%20it.)
    * As I'm based in the US, our jacks are [rated for US tons](https://manuals.harborfreight.com/manuals/56000-56999/56620.pdf)
      * 1 US ton = 2,000lbs (907kg)
    * Tesla Model 3 (2023 LR): ~4,000lbs (1,814kg) --> ~3,000lb (1,361kg) jack needed --> >1.5 ton jack
    * Tesla Model X (2021 LR): ~5,200lbs (2,359kg) --> ~3,900lb (1,769kg) jack needed --> >1.95 ton jack
    * Tesla Model S (2021 LR): ~4,600lbs (2,089kg) --> ~3,450lb (1,565kg) jack needed --> >1.73 ton jack
    * Tesla Model Y (2023 LR): ~4,600lbs (2,089kg) --> ~3,450lb (1,565kg) jack needed --> >1.73 ton jack
  * TODO: Add minimum ground clearance for tesla model 3 here
* Torque wrench up to 129lb\*ft (175N\*m)
  * [$22 Harbor Freight (recommended)](https://www.harborfreight.com/12-in-drive-20-150-ft-lb-click-torque-wrench-63882.html)
  * [$40 Amazon](https://amzn.to/3qs6ait)
* Breaker bar
  * [$22 Harbor Freight (recommended)](https://www.harborfreight.com/12-in-drive-25-in-breaker-bar-62729.html)
  * [$29 Amazon](https://amzn.to/42nrv9R)
* 21mm lug nut socker
  * [$4 single socket via Harbor Freight](https://www.harborfreight.com/12-in-drive-21mm-deep-impact-socket-67789.html)
  * [$37 impact socket set via Harbor Freight (recommended)](https://www.harborfreight.com/38-in-12-in-drive-sae-metric-impact-socket-set-37-piece-68011.html)
    * Impact sockets can be used with non-hand tools (incase you beef up your garage in the future!)
    * I believe this is the only set that Harbor Freight sells that comes with a 21mm socket
    * Also includes a 1/2" socket extension
* 1/2" socket extension
  * The lug nut is kinda far into the rim, this extension (while not totally required) will make taking the lug nut off and on much easier.
  * [$10 Harbor Freight](https://www.harborfreight.com/12-in-drive-impact-socket-extension-set-4-piece-67972.html)
