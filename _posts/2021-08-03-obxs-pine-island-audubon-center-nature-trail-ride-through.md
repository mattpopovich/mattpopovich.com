## Into
The video above shows a timelapse of a [bicycle ride](https://www.strava.com/activities/5303657216) I took on the [Pine Island Audubon Center Nature Trail](https://pineisland.audubon.org/visit/landing/nature-trail) located in Corolla, North Carolina. It is a 4.4 mile (7km) out and back trail (2.2mi (3.5km) out, an additional 2.2mi (3.5km) back). It is open to walkers, runners, and cyclists. It has two scenic overlooks that look over the Currituck Sound (0.8mi (1.3km) and 2mi (3.2km) from trail start).

## Locating the trail

The Pine Island Nature Trail is located just behind the [Pine Island Racquet and Fitness Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mfkWJ9JAQ73AtgHEA).

When I first pulled up to the entrance for the [Pine Island Racquet and Fitness Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mfkWJ9JAQ73AtgHEA) I was a bit confused because it looked like it was closed. Turns out the parking lot was closed for cars, but the nature trail was still open. As of May 15, 2021, the gate is open (for vehicle access to the parking lot) from 8AM-8PM Monday through Friday but they close at 5pm on Saturday and Sunday.

The entrance fence has a skinny entrance on the side for pedestrians / bicycles. Do note that it’s about a half mile walk from the closed gate (Audubon drive) to the beginning of the nature trail.

After traveling down Racquet Club Dr, you will find the parking lot followed by [Pine Island Racquet and Fitness Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mfkWJ9JAQ73AtgHEA). There they have a gym, indoor and outdoor tennis courts, outdoor pickleball courts, and they are open to the public.

Just past the racquet and fitness center you will find the [entrance to the nature trail](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JP6gjpuQDX5nQKy68).

## The Trail

You can view the video above for a "ride-through" of the trail in May so you know what to expect. Additional information for the trail can be found at [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/north-carolina/pine-island-audubon-center-nature-trail), which is a fantastic hiking resource with pictures, comments from fellow hikers, and other recommended hikes.

## Outro

Hope this helped give you a better idea of the Pine Island Nature Trail.

Enjoy!
