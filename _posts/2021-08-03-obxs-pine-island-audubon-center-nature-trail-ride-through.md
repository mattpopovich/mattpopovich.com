## Into
This video documents a bicycle ride I took on the Pine Island Audubon Center Nature Trail located in Corolla, North Carolina. It is a 4.4 mile (7km) out and back trail (2.2mi (3.5km) out, an additional 2.2mi (3.5km) back). It is open to walkers, runners, and cyclists. It has two scenic overlooks that look over the Currituck Sound (0.8mi (1.3km) and 2mi (3.2km) from trail start).

## Locating the trail

The Pine Island Nature Trail is located off of Audubon Drive.

When I first pulled up to the entrance for the Audubon center on Audubon drive I was a bit confused because it looked like it was closed. Turns out the parking lot is closed for cars, but the nature trail is still open. The entrance fence has a skinny entrance on the side for pedestrians / bicycles. Do note that it’s about a half mile walk from the closed gate (Audubon drive) to the beginning of the nature trail. The gate is open (to access the parking lot) from 8AM-8PM Monday through Friday but they close at 5pm on Saturday and Sunday. This is of May 15, 2021.

At the entrance of the trail is the Pine Island Racquet and fitness center. There they have a fitness center, indoor and outdoor tennis courts, and they are open to the public.
