description: New logo for the **brand**!!
---

Just had some inspiration tonight on a new logo for the ***brand***.

I drew it up on the whiteboard and sent it down to graphic design to get me some initial samples. Unfortunately, due to budget cuts, the graphic design team is on strike... So I had to throw one together my self using [~~MS~~ JS Paint](https://jspaint.app). It's such an intuitive and straightforward tool, can't understand why they wanted this "[Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)" thing.

Not too shabby if I say so myself. It has potential. More to come.

> January 4, 2023 update:
> Even though the graphic design team is still on strike, I'm happy to announce we have updated the favicon. The original was used as inspiration, but it has a more professional look, thanks to [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) (and no thanks to our graphic design team).
