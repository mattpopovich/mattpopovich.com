## [TL;DR](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/TL%3BDR)
* My 2020 LR AWD Tesla Model 3 started at the bottom of [Pikes Peak toll road entrance](TODO google maps link) at 49% state-of-charge
  * Elevation 7764ft (2366m)
  * Tesla navigation predicted 26% state-of-charge upon arrival at the peak
* Arrival at the peak was at 25% state-of-charge (-1% from prediction)
  * Elevation 14091ft (4295m)
    * +6327ft (1928m) elevation change
  * 18.2mi driven


## TODO: Add Heading Here
Range anxiety is a real thing for some electric vehicle owners, it’s even a concern for some electric vehicle passengers, such as my father.

So, with Pikes Peak International Hill Climb happening this weekend, I thought it would be a good idea to post a drive I did in my 2020 long range all-wheel drive Tesla Model 3 up Pikes Peak to see how well the Tesla Navigation’s battery prediction performed.

<!-- TODO: Reference future videos here when they are complete -->
In my next video, I’ll run the math behind this calculation to see how efficient Teslas really are at converting energy in the battery to work powering the vehicle forward.
In my following video after that, we’ll do the trip down Pikes Peak and see if Tesla’s estimate can handle all the regenerative braking coming down the mountain.

This video will show a beautiful time-lapse of the drive up to the top of Pikes Peak including everything from sunshine to rainbows.

I’ll even include an overlay of some details of the trip and how Tesla’s Navigation battery prediction changes as well as the vehicle’s current state of charge.

I initially held the camera a bit low, but I adjust it after a few minutes. Sorry about that and enjoy the ride!
