## [TL;DR](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/TL%3BDR)
* My 2020 LR AWD Tesla Model 3 started at the bottom of [Pikes Peak toll road entrance](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BaYot5KuCJKJnGHq6) at 49% state-of-charge
  * Elevation 7764ft (2366m)
  * Tesla navigation predicted 26% state-of-charge upon arrival at the peak
* Arrival at the peak was at 25% state-of-charge (-1% from prediction)
  * Elevation 14091ft (4295m)
    * +6327ft (1928m) elevation change
  * 18.2mi driven

## Intro
Range anxiety is a real thing for some electric vehicle owners, it’s even a concern for some electric vehicle passengers, such as my father.

*Example of passenger range anxiety*

So, with Pikes Peak International Hill Climb happening this weekend, I thought it would be a good idea to post a drive I did in my 2020 long range all-wheel drive Tesla Model 3 up Pikes Peak to see how well Tesla navigation’s battery prediction performed.

<!-- TODO: Reference next post here when they are complete. Physics of how much energy physics says is minimally required -->
<!-- TODO: Fix YouTube video card, this video has not been made yet. It is not the EPA video -->
In my next post, I’ll run the math behind this calculation to see how efficient Teslas really are at converting energy in the battery to work powering the vehicle forward.
<!-- TODO: Reference future post here of trip down pikes peak -->
In my following video after that, we’ll do the trip down Pikes Peak and see if Tesla’s estimate can handle all the regenerative braking coming down the mountain.

This video will show a beautiful time-lapse of the drive up to the top of Pikes Peak including everything from sunshine to rainbows.

I’ll even include an overlay of some details of the trip:
* How Tesla’s navigation battery prediction changes
* The vehicle’s current state of charge
* Map of the car's current location along the path of the trip
* Current grade / slope / incline <!--TODO what do these mean, which is right-->of the road

I initially held the camera a bit low, but I adjust it after a few minutes. Sorry about that and enjoy the ride!
