## <small>Hello</small>

Many people have been asking me[^correction], "Matt, now that you're a big wig on YouTube with a massive 200 subscriber base, how much [dough](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dough) are you bringing in?"

And while that's a complicated question with many moving parts, the long story short is, still...... âœ¨ nothing âœ¨

&nbsp;

...

&nbsp;

So I guess there's a little bit more to the story. The good news is, whenever I link to an item that is on Amazon, I will use a [referral link](https://amzn.to/3ynaBva). Anytime someone clicks on that link and purchases the item, I will get a cut of the profit. In total, I have made $6.16... [pretty good](https://youtu.be/Yas39c-RNzk?t=11)!

Now the bad news is, Amazon has shut down my affiliate account because I don't have the minimum number of subscribers to be in the affiliate program. So... I guess I'm back to the drawing board.

I'll give you all the next update at 1,000 subscribers ðŸ¤ž
