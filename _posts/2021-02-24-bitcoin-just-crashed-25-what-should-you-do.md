## Intro
All right boys and girls, big day today in the crypto community. As the legendary trader ([/s](TODO: SARCASM)) "[Davey Day Trader Global](TODO)" (DDTG) would say:
> "**Emergency press conference**"

## Chapter
Bitcoin just crashed 25% today (TODO: date). And some are saying "the sky is falling", "SOS", "mayday", "RIP", "[I'm never going to financially recover from this](TODO: link)". But I'm here to tell you that if you can stay the course, not panic, and *breathe*, things are going to be just fine.

If this is something that you don't think that you can handle, then maybe bitcoin's not for you as this is actually not too far out of the ordinary for bitcoin.

> I'm also here to explain that I know next to nothing about money, finances, the economy, and I'm **definitely** not a certified financial planner (CFP). I'm really not even certified in much of anything.
> In other words, please do your own research (DYOR) before investing and listening to Joe Schmoe off of YouTube. No offense to any Joe Schmoes out there, I'm sure you're all very knowledgeable people.
> This article is just my opinion and I'm going to vent on my thoughts.
> Let's go.

## Chapter
This video is mainlly meant for someone who recently started investing into crypto. Although, I think even people that have been in the crypto space for a few years could probably gain something from this. With that said, I've been following the crypto space closely since 2013 or so and excuse me while I throw a few quotes at you:
> "Past performance is not an indicator of future results"

> "If it ain't broke, don't fix it"

> "History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes"

In other words, what I'm trying to say is there is no guarantee that these things will continue to happen but, for now, it seems to be a good indicator.
