## Intro
Another post in my series of [Audi-related posts](/tags/audi). This time I'm going to be replacing the front dashboard air vent grille (for lack of a better word). This is the vent that will direct air towards the driver or passenger window to prevent it from fogging up due to condensation.

It's very easy to replace. There's four "clips" on each grille which keep it in place with the dash. Two on the top of the grille and two on the bottom of the grille.

### Tools Required
* Flathead screwdriver
  * I purchased [this set from Amazon (affiliate link)](https://amzn.to/3ZXHTzT) and have used it countless times for various repairs throughout the years. I highly recommend it.

## Removing the Grille
To remove the grille, grab a flathead screwdriver, slide it into the top of the grille, pull the grille towards you to slightly squeeze the grille and disengage the top two clips, then lift the grill upwards.

TODO: Add screwdriver set to video description!

## Inserting the Grille
To insert the grille, rotate it such that the vents will direct air onto the window (and not towards the windshield). Then insert it at an angle such that the bottom two clips are nearly in place, then push the top of the grille into place. When done successfully, you should hear a "click" letting you know that the clips have engaged into the proper location.

## Are the Grilles Interchangeable?
I tried to insert the passenger (right) front dash air vent grille into the driver (left) but no luck. Unfortunately, the two grilles are not symmetric and are not interchangeable.

## Replacing the Grilles
I wish there was a file to 3D print these, it would be like $1 of plastic, but I could not find any files online.

Be extra careful when purchasing, make sure you get the correct side vent. As previously mentioned, the driver (left) and passenger (right) vents are slightly different. Searching by the specific part number (`8V1-819-793` or `8V1-819-794`) is normally a safe bet. Note that sometimes the distributors are lazy and show a preview image for the incorrect side. Ensure the part number and side (driver = left, passenger = right) are as you expect.

### Purchasing new Grilles
I purchased from [audiusaparts.com](https://www.audiusaparts.com/), but I imagine you would have similar success purchasing from Audi directly or even eBay.
* [Audi USA Parts.com: Driver Vent (~$20 + ~$30 shipping = ~$50)](https://www.audiusaparts.com/oem-parts/audi-air-vent-grille-8v18197936ps)
* [Audi USA Parts.com: Passenger Vent (~$20 + ~$30 shipping = ~$50)](https://www.audiusaparts.com/oem-parts/audi-air-vent-grille-8v18197946ps)
* [audi.oempartsonline.com](https://audi.oempartsonline.com/) (~$22 + ~$5 shipping = ~$30)
