## Into

This video takes place in Bear Creek Lake Park out in Lakewood, Colorado. This is my first in a series of Tesla Model 3 videos. Today weâ€™re going to be doing an autopilot test. This road is a little windy, itâ€™s well marked, and the top speed is 25mph (40kmph). This is really where autopilot struggles - on sharp turns where it needs to brake below the speed limit.

In this ride we'll do two attempts in both directionsn for four total attempts. Each direction is tested twice for repeatability.

My Tesla Model 3 is running autopilot (not FSD) `v10.2 (2021.24.12)`.

This is not a complaint or anything against autopilot. Autopilot is a great piece of software. I am just doing this for documentations sake and to repeat this test to see how much better the software (does or doesn't) get.

## Outro
All right boys and girls, I think thatâ€™s a wrap, thanks for watching. Moral of the story, donâ€™t fall asleep while your Tesla is driving... yet. In the future, I plan on making a bunch of Tesla model 3 videos, once theyâ€™re up, Iâ€™ll put a link to a playlist of them here. Also in the future, my next Tesla video will just be a roundup of everything I saw on sentry mode and Teslaâ€™s dash cam in 2021.

Lastly, there's about 10 days left until the big jolly man comes (ðŸŽ…), hope you're all on the nice list!

Merry early Christmas to all, and to all, goodnight.
