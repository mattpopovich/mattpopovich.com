## Intro
This post documents the snowfall at my house in Denver, CO during winter storm Xylia from Friday March 12, 2021 through Sunday March 14, 2021.

It started with some brief rain on the 13th around 11AM, then snow, then it all melted by 3PM that same day. Snow dabbled on and off until 1AM on the 14th. The early hours of the 14th is when things started picking up. We went from 5" on the ground at 9AM to 15" by 1PM = over two inches an hour! My external battery bank died (I [went snowboarding hehe](https://www.strava.com/activities/4953024038) and neglected to swap in some new batteries beforehand) around this time. The next picture I took was at 10PM when the storm was over with 16" of total snowfall.

## [TL;DR](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/TL%3BDR)
Denver metro received ~16" of snow in ~12 hours from 1AM March 14th, 2021 to 1PM on the same day. While not a record, Weather Underground says "[Xylia was the fourth-heaviest snowstorm on record in Denver (27.1 inches)](https://www.wunderground.com/article/storms/winter/news/2021-03-11-winter-storm-xylia-snow-records-since-fall-2020)", Wikipedia says [it was Denver's second-largest March snowfall on record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2021_North_American_blizzard).

## Graph
I went through the [YouTube video above](https://youtu.be/n7fOENeADLg) and made a rough estimate at snowfall totals whenever there was ~a half inch (1.27cm) change from the previous measurement.

## Outro
16" is a lot for metro denver!

> Note that some people refer to this as 32" of snowfall: 16" in the front yard, 16" in the back yard
>
> Also note that when I say "some people", I only know of one person that does this ðŸ˜‰
