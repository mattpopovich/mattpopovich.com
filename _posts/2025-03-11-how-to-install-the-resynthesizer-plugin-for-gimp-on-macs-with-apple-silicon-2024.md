## Intro
Welp, back at it again with *another* GIMP and Resynthesizer update. Per usual, this update is long overdue. But, I think this is the easiest installation yet and I did a good bit of tweaking to make this install as easy as possible. All you need to do is copy a few files over, and you should be good to go.

Additionally, I have this post titled 2024 because the most recent version of GIMP for Mac (2.10.38 revision 1) [was published on May 22, 2024](https://download.gimp.org/gimp/v2.10/osx/?C=M&O=D). GIMP is currently working on releasing GIMP 3.0, and it [seems like they're very close to releasing it](https://www.gimp.org/news/2025/02/10/gimp-3-0-RC3-released/)... So there's probably a decent chance that I'll be creating a 2025 update once that releases.

### Backstory
A little bit of backstory, I originally had trouble installing the Resynthesizer plugin back in 2021. Once I managed to install it, I made a post and video about how I did it. There was a good bit of interest from the community! I then had someone reach out to me and point out an easier way to complete the installation, so I made an update video in 2022. Again, with a decent amount of interest. However, a few months later, GIMP [released an updated build for Apple Silicon (ARM) processors](https://www.gimp.org/news/2022/12/02/gimp-2.10.32-apple-silicon/), which broke my installation. My installation still worked as long as you used an older version of GIMP, but now I've found a way to make things work with the newest version of GIMP. Let's jump into it.
