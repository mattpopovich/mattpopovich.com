## Intro
Powerline to ethernet adapters aren't great, and many people online swear against them. But, they do have a use case: you do not want to (or cannot) run ethernet or coaxial cables and WiFi does not reach or is too unreliable. If this is your scenario, powerline might be a quick and easy solution. The good thing about powerline is that it's extremely easy to test: buy two adapters and plug them into the wall! No construction necessary.

>In short: `Ethernet > Coax > WiFi >> Powerline `

If you understand powerline's weaknesses, I believe that it can be an effective tool to supplement your network. Here is how and why I added it to my network, what speeds you can realistically expect out of powerline, and tips for getting the most out of powerline adapters.

## Why I Added Powerline to my Network
I was upgrading the WiFi in my (a friend's) house, and I first tested my current WiFi speeds using [`iperf3`](https://iperf.fr) at various locations around the house to establish a baseline. Then I tested [a wireless mesh network](https://amzn.to/452BPsZ) and how different locations for access points affected performance, and lastly I tested the mesh network but with an ethernet backhaul [over coaxial](https://amzn.to/4kRYNYA), which was the best option.

However, my garage is disconnected from the house and receives pretty poor WiFi performance. I didn't really want to run a new wire the whole way to the garage... but then I remembered I already have wires running to the garage (electricity) and I can try to run ethernet over that! I didn't need a lot of speed, I just wanted consistent, reliable performance. Thus, if powerline could give me a reliable >20Mbps, I could use that as an "ethernet backhaul" to then add another wireless access point to the mesh network and cover the whole garage with reliable WiFi!

Spoiler alert: it actually worked pretty well! Let's get into some numbers:

## Real-world Powerline Speeds

### Testing Setup
The house I'm testing this on was built in the 1980s-1990s. I don't know exactly what that means in terms of electrical wiring standards, but you can probably expect a bit worse performance if your house is older, and better performance if your house is newer. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

My testing setup is capable of ~1Gbps throughput. A 10 second `iperf3` test from laptop --> ethernet --> router --> ethernet --> laptop gave 918Mbps. We'll be effectively performing the same test but removing the router and adding the powerline adapters. Thus, this system is capable of testing *up to* 918Mbps.

All tests will be 10s runs of `iperf3`. I'll run it twice and report the average.

### Speeds

#### Testing from Central Point in the House
I set up shop in a central room in the house and started testing throughput to other outlets. The first thing I test was two outlets directly (~6ft) next to each other only gave ~325Mbps. So... do not expect to reach the "1000Mbps" given by the marketing material.
