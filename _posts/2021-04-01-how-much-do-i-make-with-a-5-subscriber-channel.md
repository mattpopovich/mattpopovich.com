*April Fools!*

As I mentioned in my [previous post](/posts/preview-wowgo-2s-range-test/), WowGo was having a promotion where they were paying creators to make a video about their electric longboard.

![WowGo Promotion](/assets/img/posts/2020-12-01-preview-wowgo-2s-range-test/wow-go-promotion.jpg){: width="400"} *WowGo's Promotion*

I made a video. I got paid.

![Receipt of $15 payment sent via PayPal](/assets/img/posts/2021-04-01-how-much-do-i-make-with-a-5-subscriber-channel/WowGoPayment.png){: width="400"} *Receipt*

In other words:

{% include embed/youtube.html id='Yas39c-RNzk?start=14' %}

Business is *booming*
