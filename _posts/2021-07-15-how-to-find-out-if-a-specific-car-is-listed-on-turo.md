## Intro
Good afternoon! Matt Popovich here for my first post discussing Turo things. I recently just hit 100 trips on Turo! 👏 Eventually I want to put up a video talking through my thoughts on Turo after my first 100 trips. But, for now, I want to talk about how to tell if a car a car is currently listed on Turo or not. Maybe you're looking at purchasing and you don't want to purchase a car that's been rented, or maybe your buddy just pulled up in a brand new lambo and you know he can't afford it and you're really hoping it's rented...

Regardless of your motives, here's how:

## [TL;DR](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/TL%3BDR)
* Sign into your Turo host account
* Try to list a new vehicle by VIN
* If it doesn't let you, you'll know that the vehicle is currently listed on Turo
  * If it does let you list the vehicle, that just means that the vehicle isn't *currently* listed on Turo.
  * It doesn't tell us anything about whether the vehicle used to be on Turo or not... Maybe the owner took the vehicle off of Turo, we don't really know.

## TODO
For this to work, you'll need two things:
1. A Turo (host) account
2. The VIN number of the vehicle in question

Once logged in, go to your [vehicles tab](), then try to list a new vehicle. Add in an address, then you'll notice we can't get any further without putting in a VIN number. So, let's get the VIN that we're interested in and input it. We have to fill out a few more fields (odometer, transmission, trim), then before you get to the "goals" section, if the car is on Turo, you will get the following warning:

![Prompt you get when a VIN is already listed on turo](TODO)

> We're sorry
>
> It looks like this VIN is already listed, but you're free to list a different car. Please contact support if you think there's been an error.

## TODO
That's good and all, but if this screen doesn't come up, that doesn't mean that this car *hasn't* been listed on Turo before. That just means that the vehicle isn't ***currently*** listed on Turo. Maybe the owner took the vehicle off of Turo, or maybe it hasn't been listed at all... we don't really know.

But if you **do** get the above screen, you can be sure that the vehicle **is** currently listed on Turo, and you can make... whatever decisions you need to make from this information.


## Outro
There you have it, short and sweet. Funny enough, I found out about this little trick by looking into purchasing a Tesla Model 3 from a private party and I was doing some research on the car and I figured, *I'm already a Turo host, let me pull up Turo and see how this car's competition is looking in my market, what they're currently priced at, etc.*, and, lo' (TODO spelling) and behold, with a little detective work, I end up finding the exact vehicle that I'm looking at buying on Turo!

![IMG](TODO)

Fast forward, I end up buying the car and when I got to try to add it to my account on Turo, it hits me with the *We're sorry. It looks like this VIN is already listed on Turo*. So, I can either contact Turo and I can show them the registration, title, bill of sale, etc. and they can put the car under my account, or, since I know who I bought it from, I can contact them and have them remove it from their account.

But, that's how we got here, thanks for reading. Hope this helps!
