# Intro
Every year, Apple comes out with a new Apple Watch, and they update their [comparison page](https://www.apple.com/watch/compare/). The comparison is between their currently available models. They have a link to "See all models", but for some reason, it isn't presented in a helpful format. They could easily let us select different models to be used in the comparison, such as they do for their [iPhone comparison page](https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/), but they don't, and I hope to fix that.

Ken Rockwell has a [detailed comparison page](https://www.kenrockwell.com/apple/watch/compared.htm), I hope to make mine only hit the main points.
