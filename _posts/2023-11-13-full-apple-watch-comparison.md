# Intro
Every year, Apple comes out with a new Apple Watch, and they update their [comparison page](https://www.apple.com/watch/compare/). The comparison is between their currently available models. They have a link to "See all models", but for some reason, it isn't presented in a helpful format. They could easily let us select different models to be used in the comparison, such as they do for their [iPhone comparison page](https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/), but they don't, and I hope to fix that.

Ken Rockwell has a [detailed comparison page](https://www.kenrockwell.com/apple/watch/compared.htm), I hope to make mine only hit the main points.

## Comparison Table
|Ultra 2|Ultra|Series 9|Series 8|SE 2nd gen|Series7|Series 6|SE 1st gen|Series 5|Series 4|Series 3|Series 2|Series 1|
|-------|-----|--------|--------|----------|-------|--------|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|49mm   |     |45mm or 41mm|




## My Recommendation

I wouldn't get anything below a Series 4. Mainly because watchOS 10 only supports Series 4 and higher, but the 4 has some serious upgrades over the 3 as well (screen size, processor, ECG, fall detection, Bluetooth 5.0, 16GB storage).
Series 5 adds an always on display (or better battery life if you turn off the always-on display)
Series 6 adds a blood oxygen sensor (not very useful in my opinion)
Series 7 adds basically nothing
Series 8 adds basically nothing
Series 9 adds a new processor and brighter screen. They also advertise a feature called ["double tap"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-ZXg3uA0Y), but that is actually available in older watches as an [accessibility feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDpIhooDyaY).

The first gen SE is basically a Series 5 witout the ECG and always-on display. The second gen SE is pretty similar to the first but with a newer processor, crash detection, and better WiFi and bluetooth.

Basically nobody *needs* the Apple Watch Ultra vs. a normal Series X, but if you really want double the battery life and an additional button, go for it.
