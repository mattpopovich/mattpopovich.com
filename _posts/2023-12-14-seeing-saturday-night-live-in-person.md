## Intro

> [Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!](https://youtu.be/tajtbq-1vC0)

That iconic phrase is the last line from Saturday Night Live's (SNL) [*cold open*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_open#:~:text=A%20cold%20open%20\(also%20called,or%20opening%20credits%20are%20shown.). I was **extremely lucky** to have the chance to see SNL in person for season 49's episode 7 on December 9, 2023. The show was hosted by [Adam Driver](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3485845/) with musical guest [Olivia Rodrigo](https://www.youtube.com/@OliviaRodrigo/videos).

In this post, I'm going to walk you through what it was like to see SNL in person as well as giving you some tips and tricks if you ever get the same opportunity!

## Getting Tickets
This year, I found out that SNL tickets are free!! All you have to do is apply for them and win the lottery! [Applying for tickets](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/how-to-get-SNL-tickets) is done by [sending an email](mailto:SNLTICKETS@NBCUNI.COM) during the month of August. The main thing they ask is you include "why you would like to be a part of SNL's studio audience", which I imagine is a main part of the selection process.

You can also [apply for standby tickets](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/how-to-get-SNL-tickets) at 10AM Thursdays before the show, but I'm not terribly familiar with how that works.

## Getting to the Show
The show is at the Rockefeller Center at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. They say you have to be there by 9PM, otherwise your tickets won't be honored. **Don't be late!!** Even I, with my great talent of always being late, managed to show up around 8:40PM. I'd recommend getting dinner downtown before the show so that worst case, if you're late, you skip dinner and don't miss the show.

I'd recommend taking the subway in. If you're new to New York, the subway can be a little tricky with making sure you're on the right line, going the right direction, plus handling transfers if necessary. Give yourself some cushion. Google Maps and Apple Maps both do well with transit directions. I was 9/12 getting on the correct subway in my first time in New York. Two of those mishaps were my first two attempts so overall I'd say not too bad once I figured out what was going on.

## Pre-Show

### Checking in
You line up in front of a set of stairs ("The Grand Stair") closed off with glass doors. If you ask people that work there, they can direct you. There won't be anyone official looking there just yet, but if you ask the people in line, that can help confirm you're in the right spot. By around 855PM someone official will start directing traffic and telling you that this line is only for SNL guests with reservations, etc.

To go up the stairs, you'll show a copy of your email (the .pdf says to please print this ticket but most people just had it on their phones and that was fine) + show photo IDs for you and your guest (to make sure you're above 16 and to check the name matches your lottery email).

Once you're up the stairs, you'll be in a "staging/queueing area". I believe this is where they decide who will be getting seats on the floor and who will be in the stands. Reddit says to ["wear darker things without logos to have a better chance of getting floor seats"](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/yl6e3q/i_am_attending_snl_for_the_first_time_next/iux0jfb/). I had a navy button up on and my friend had a beige sweater... and we both got on the floor!!! In my observation, either you and your guest will both get on the floor, or neither of you will. They won't split you up.

TODO: Image of staging/queuing area

Once you leave this staging/queueing area, you'll be given two wristbands, your ticket, and you'll go through metal detectors. Continue walking and you'll be given a few canned alcoholic drinks to choose from (**this will be your only chance at alcohol until the show is over**), then you'll arrive at the *Peacock Lounge*.
