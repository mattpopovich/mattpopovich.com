description: Opening the hood on an Audi A3 is very simple - here's how!

## Intro
Hey guys! Matt Popovich here. Today in my [series of Audi posts](/tags/audi/), I'm going to show you how to open the hood. This is very simple and while I will be demonstrating it on a 2015 Audi A3, the procedure will likely be the same for any Audi or Volkswagen models, and will be similar for most other cars. Check your vehicle's owners manual for the specific procedure for your car.

## Opening the Hood
First, make sure your wiper arms are not raised from the windshield. Otherwise, the paint on the hood could be damaged upon open. Next, you will need to open the front driver door. Then, between the speaker on the bottom of the door and where the driver's left foot would be, pull the hood release towards the driver. Upon pulling, you will hear the hood somewhat "unlock" as we have just released the primary latch. This release is in the inside of your car for security so that any random person can't open your hood from the outside.

Next, we will go to the front of the car. Underneath the front center of the hood you will find the "rocker switch". Pull the end of the switch upwards to release the hood. This additional step is for safety in case you accidentally release the hood or [if the hood release fails while driving](https://youtu.be/n1lbpj6868o), the hood will remain closed and not obstruct your view.
