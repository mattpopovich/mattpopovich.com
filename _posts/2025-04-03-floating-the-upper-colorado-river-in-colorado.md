description: My notes and research on floating the Colorado part of the Upper Colorado River
---

## Intro
I love floating rivers. I want to someday float the Colorado River. This is where I'm going to keep my notes.

## Floating the Upper Colorado River
> "[Gently flowing through non-intimidating whitewater](https://www.coloradodirectory.com/rafting/colorado.html)"

The "Upper Colorado River Basin" is defined by the river network above [Lee's Ferry](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UFUSjERq4BFQDa9Q9) in northern Arizona (Grand Canyon) ([Source](https://www.americanrivers.org/river/upper-basin-of-the-colorado-river/)). This post will cover floating from [Kremmling, CO](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3pkzXU7WKAzZiZPK6) to [Dotsero, CO](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ApJ972qULBDT9XY99). This area is about 1hr northwest of Vail, 2.5hr west of Denver.

### Map

* Blue = Put Ins / Pull Outs
* Red = Rapids
* Yellow = POI (Point of Interest) / Information
* Purple = Campsites

Note that there are very likely dispersed campsites that I missed. Some of the launch (put in / pull out) locations have camping too.

#### Map Sources
I basically took all the information from the below links and fused them into one map:
* [Great brochure on floating the Upper Colorado River](https://org.coloradomesa.edu/~jerry/guide/uppercoloradoriverbrochure_032305.pdf)
  * Includes a map and a small paragraph for each section. Judging from the link URL, I think it's from 2005.
* [PDF with labels on each boat ramp, campground, and rapid](https://www.blm.gov/sites/default/files/docs/2021-07/Upper_CO_River_20190716.pdf)
  * Judging from the URL, I think it's from 2019.
* [BLM (bureau of land management) interactive fullscreen map of the Upper Colorado River Recreation Area](https://blm-egis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=5ff8af48479a4bf3b3a4f34eb4958f9d&level=13&marker=-106.5084,39.9844,,Upper%20Colorado%20River%20Recreation%20Area,https://www.blm.gov/themes/custom/blm_d9_22/favicon.ico,Upper%20Colorado%20River%20Recreation%20Area)
  * Includes markings for launch sites, camping, rapids, hiking, parking, and restrooms. Yellow shaded region is BLM land, otherwise the land is private. I imagine this is constantly updated.
* [Awesome, modern, interactive brochure](https://blm-egis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=8c49def5acd34631a1f135880937e84e)
  * I didn't actually use this... found it afterwards. It's basically a combination of the [first](https://org.coloradomesa.edu/~jerry/guide/uppercoloradoriverbrochure_032305.pdf) and [third](https://blm-egis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=5ff8af48479a4bf3b3a4f34eb4958f9d&level=13&marker=-106.5084,39.9844,,Upper%20Colorado%20River%20Recreation%20Area,https://www.blm.gov/themes/custom/blm_d9_22/favicon.ico,Upper%20Colorado%20River%20Recreation%20Area) links.

### Notes on Sections

Additional information not easily represented in the map or table:

* [Parshall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FtmJsvWrq9KcmgZr5) to [Blue River / Kremmling](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rF4oEJxVkmzbqcqD7)
  * Can't find much information online about this section. Probably because no one puts in here to avoid going through Gore Canyon. Looks calm?
* [Blue River / Kremmling](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rF4oEJxVkmzbqcqD7) to [Pumphouse (BLM)](https://goo.gl/maps/NLFAk8tt1n1CJKvx9)
  * Gore Canyon, considered "[the most intense rafting in the state](https://www.coloradodirectory.com/rafting/colorado.html)" and possibly the United States!
    * One section of the river drops at 68ft/mile
  * Class IV and V whitewater, experts only, definitely not suitable for floating
* [Pumphouse (BLM)](https://goo.gl/maps/NLFAk8tt1n1CJKvx9) to [Radium Campground (BLM)](https://goo.gl/maps/vC11eaRzrzqjyz3F7)
  * Heavily used
  * Pumphouse parking is $5 (2015) which includes parking for the day, camping, and launch fees. Covers take out at everything except Rancho del Rio. [Source](https://www.coloradorivercenter.com/river-info.html)
  * This will take you through Little Gore Canyon
  * Small warm spring further below the rapid on the left bank at the foot of the cliffs. Watch out for poison ivy on the banks and around the rocks.
    * Warm spring can get crowded. Cliff jumping can attract characters.
* [Radium Campground (BLM)](https://goo.gl/maps/vC11eaRzrzqjyz3F7) to [Rancho del Rio (private)](https://goo.gl/maps/F5mtZjbWKhkXJEqr7)
  * Looks like large sections of the river here are not close to a road.
* [Rancho del Rio (private)](https://goo.gl/maps/F5mtZjbWKhkXJEqr7) to [State Bridge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q9txFexhBAQyDyJo9)
  * Separate fees for launching or taking out from Rancho del Rio
  * Contact the [BLM Kremmling Field Office](https://www.blm.gov/office/kremmling-field-office) for questions about the river between Pumphouse and State Bridge
  * Some campsites may be close to railroad tracks
* [State Bridge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q9txFexhBAQyDyJo9) to [Two Bridges](https://goo.gl/maps/H2r5ydQdfzCyMx6q8)
  * State Bridge can get very busy
  * Theater here with live music all summer long
  * If river is over 5500cfs, the second bridge cannot be floated under. Emergency take-out is on the right between the two bridges.
* [Two Bridges](https://goo.gl/maps/H2r5ydQdfzCyMx6q8) to [Catamount Bridge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NbpdPnYzdR32GeVz9)
  * "The McCoy Waterwheel is the largest waterwheel in Colorado", built in 1922. [Source, pg. 19](https://org.coloradomesa.edu/~jerry/guide/uppercoloradoriverbrochure_032305.pdf)
* [Catamount Bridge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NbpdPnYzdR32GeVz9) to [Pinball](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PTsJygM5uS5gf7kJ8)
* [Pinball](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PTsJygM5uS5gf7kJ8) to [Horse Creek](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tMoYXWhGLhfyzzoc6)
  * If the river is above 5500cfs, the water might be too high to go underneath twin bridges / Red Dirt bridge.
* [Horse Creek](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tMoYXWhGLhfyzzoc6) to [Cottonwood Island](https://goo.gl/maps/pSjVNaH9tkaWRBC36)
* [Cottonwood Island](https://goo.gl/maps/pSjVNaH9tkaWRBC36) to [Lyons Gulch](https://goo.gl/maps/fyuAswo9CRnRpzyq7)
* [Lyons Gulch](https://goo.gl/maps/fyuAswo9CRnRpzyq7) to [Dotsero Landing](https://goo.gl/maps/8wo7XpydVvSV9DY3A)
  * Contact the [BLM Colorado River Valley Field Office](https://www.blm.gov/office/colorado-river-valley-field-office) for questions between State Bridge and Dotsero
* [Dotsero Landing](https://goo.gl/maps/8wo7XpydVvSV9DY3A) to [Bair Ranch](https://goo.gl/maps/N87LqLjckXfjR3y49)
  * Blair Ranch is the furthest downstream take out before entering the Glenwood Canyon runs. If you continue further down, you'll hit Hanging Lake dam.
  * "[You can find several undeveloped warm springs near RM 71](https://org.coloradomesa.edu/~jerry/guide/uppercoloradoriverbrochure_032305.pdf)"

## Flow Rates
* Flow rate recommendations ([source](https://skiboulder.com/pages/where-to-go-tubing-upper-colorado-river)):
  * The Upper Colorado is almost never too low to float
    * May and June could be too high
    * May - September is best
  * 300 - 800cfs = mellow float, Radium to Dotsero are all good
  * 800 - 1500cfs = potentially exciting float, Lyons Gulch to Dotsero is best
  * 1500cfs - 5000cfs = exciting float, Lyons Gulch to Dotsero is best
  * \>5000cfs = not recommended to float except for Dotsero to Blair Ranch
* [FLow rate at Kremmling](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/09058000/#dataTypeId=continuous-00060-0&period=P7D&showMedian=false), start of the float. [Flow rate at Dotsero](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/09070500/#parameterCode=00060&period=P7D), end of the float.
  * If you go down to the "Continuous data" box (maroon), you can also graph water temperature (click "Graph it"), among other things.

## Additional Information
* A permit is not required to float the Upper Colorado River. [Source](https://www.riversports.com/blogs/4crs/5-river-trips-that-dont-require-a-permit). [Another source](https://riverbent.com/planning-an-upper-colorado-river-trip/).
* I haven't found concrete information on if a PFD (personal flotation device) is legally required.

## Basic Supplies
* PFD
* Spare oar/paddle
* First aid kit
* Repair kit (duct tape) and air pump
* Throw/rescue line
* Bailing bucket
* Food
* Sunscreen
* Sunglasses
* Insect repellant
* Hat, extra shoes, dry clothes
* Waterproof bags or containers
