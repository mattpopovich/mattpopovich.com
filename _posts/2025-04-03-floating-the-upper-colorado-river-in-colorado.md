description: My notes and research on floating the Upper Colorado River
---

## Intro
I love floating rivers. I want to someday float the Colorado River. This is where I'm going to keep my notes.

## Floating the Upper Colorado River
> "[Gently flowing through non-intimidating whitewater](https://www.coloradodirectory.com/rafting/colorado.html)"

The "Upper Colorado River Basin" is defined by the river network above [Lee's Ferry](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UFUSjERq4BFQDa9Q9) in northern Arizona (Grand Canyon) ([Source](https://www.americanrivers.org/river/upper-basin-of-the-colorado-river/)). This post will cover floating from [Kremmling, CO](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3pkzXU7WKAzZiZPK6) to [Dotsero, CO](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ApJ972qULBDT9XY99). This area is about 1hr northwest of Vail, 2.5hr west of Denver.

Note that RM is an abbreviation for "river mile". RM 0.0 is at the Highway 9 bridge near Kremmling. [Source, pg. 7](https://org.coloradomesa.edu/~jerry/guide/uppercoloradoriverbrochure_032305.pdf)

## Flow Rates
* Flow rate recommendations ([source](https://skiboulder.com/pages/where-to-go-tubing-upper-colorado-river)):
  * The Upper Colorado is almost never too low to float
    * May and June could be too high
    * May - September is best
  * 300 - 800cfs = mellow float, Radium to Dotsero are all good
  * 800 - 1500cfs = potentially exciting float, Lyons Gulch to Dotsero is best
  * 1500cfs - 5000cfs = exciting float, Lyons Gulch to Dotsero is best
  * \>5000cfs = not recommended to float except for Dotsero to Blair Ranch
* [Flow rate at Dotsero](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/09070500/#parameterCode=00060&period=P7D)
