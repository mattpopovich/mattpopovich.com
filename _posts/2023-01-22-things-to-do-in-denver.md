## Intro
As a [Turo host](https://turo.com/us/en/drivers/325768) (car sharing) and a guy that moved to Denver with only knowing two people that were living here, I have lots of customers and friends visiting me asking for recommendations on things to do in Denver and Colorado. I aim to combine my thoughts here to serve as a reference for myself...and others!

## Skiing / Snowboarding
If you have an Epic or Ikon pass, you probably already have a plan of where you're going. If you want to go to one of those resorts, your options will either be a season pass or a day pass. Season passes are only sold until ~November. Season passes are $500-$1200 depending on when you buy them (cheaper the sooner you buy them) and how much access you want (blackout dates on holidays will result in cheaper passes). Day passes go for ~$200 nowadays (ridiculous). If you ski with a season pass holder, they can buy you reduced day passes but they're still very expensive.

If you don't have an Epic or Ikon pass, there are a few resorts left that have refused to get bought out by a conglomerate. Their day passes will be much more reasonable. And if you're a beginner shredder, they're a great place to learn. Day tickets at these places are around $100.

## Hiking
Unlike skiing, hiking is something to do in Denver and its nearby areas **year-round**.

AllTrails ([Apple App Store](https://alltrails.io/ujRkr9MGmgb), Google Play Store](https://alltrails.io/pW7o6i6Lmgb))is the defacto app for finding places to hike and recording your hiking activities. I highly recommend it for any prospective hikers, no matter where you live.

If you are in shape and active, you can do most AllTrails hikes rated as "hard" (Ex. I would not take any normal parents above 50 years old on this hike but any college student that plays intramural sports should be fine). I believe anyone that can go for a 3mi (5km) walk can do an "easy" hike. The "moderate" hikes are somewhere in between the two ðŸ˜œ

The best thing about AllTrails is their ratings and information about hikes. [This](https://www.alltrails.com/us/colorado) is a link to their most highly ranked hikes in Colorado (I have done half of them and can confirm). [This](https://www.alltrails.com/us/colorado/denver) is a link to their best hikes in Denver (more like walks in the park). Search for the area you are staying in or what is near you and go from there.

Here are some of my favorites:
* Washington Park
  * 2.3mi easy paved loop 15min from Denver
  * An easy walk in Denver's best park (my opinion)
  * Also has a gravel running/jogging trail, paved loop for bicycling/roller blading.
  * Plenty of geese and people playing volleball and enjoying time with friends here
  * Very popular but lots of space
* Royal Arch
 * 3.4mi hard hike located in Boulder, CO (35min from Denver)
 * Fantastic views of Boulder
 * Lots of other hikes here, be careful making a wrong turn
 * Very popular

## Concerts
* Red rocks
* Fillmore
* Fiddler's Green
* Ball Arena (aka Pepsi Center)

## Other
* Rent a scooter/bicycle and explore the city
 * Easier when you have a tour guide that can lead you to bicycle friendly roads
 * E-bikes are great for older / less active family members
* Bicycle around Dillon reservoir
  * The most scenic bicycle ride that I've ever done
  * 19mi loop with some steep sections (but you can always turn around!)
  * E-bikes available for rent nearby that make this accessible for almost everyone
* Acquarium
  * TODO


## Water things
* Cherry Creek Reservoir
* Chatfield Reservoir
* Bear Creek Lake
* Water park in north denver
