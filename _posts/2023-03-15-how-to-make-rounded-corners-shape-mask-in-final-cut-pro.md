## Intro
Ok, super quick post here. I'm working in [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) and I want to be able to put a screenshot or another clip in my video and I don't like the super sharp corners of the video that happens with the overlay. I'd like them to be a little more soft and rounded. I did some Googling to try to figure out how to do this and the first couple of links weren't terribly obvious with their solutions... but there is an easy solution (apply a shape mask) and I'm going to show you how to do it!
