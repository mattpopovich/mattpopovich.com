<!-- TODO: Make a YouTube video on all this?? -->

## Intro
As a [Turo host](https://turo.com/us/en/drivers/325768) (car sharing) and a guy that moved to Denver when only knowing two people that were living here, I have lots of guests and friends visiting me asking for recommendations on things to do in Denver and Colorado. I aim to combine my thoughts here to serve as a reference for myself...and others!

P.S. To keep this post to appear shorter than it is, I have included "spoilers" in some of the sections. Click on them to expand additional information. (Look for the ‚ùóÔ∏è)

## Skiing / Snowboarding
Colorado is home to some of the [best skiing in all of North America](https://www.snowpak.com/usa/best-ski-resorts-north-america), many of it an hour or two drive from Denver. I **have** to start this post by covering [the gnar](https://www.powder7.com/ski-blog/ski-slang-explained-shred-the-gnar-and-beyond/#:~:text=Shred%20the%20Gnar%20%E2%80%93%20the%20far,blower%20lines%20with%20reckless%20abandon.) ü§ô‚õ∑üèÇ

Visit [COtrip.org](https://maps.cotrip.org/@-106.1268,39.77425,9?show=winterDriving,roadReports) for webcams and road conditions provided by the state. The webcams are actually very handy and the road closures are useful during big snow storms.

If you're a beginner, take a look at [Ruby Hill](https://denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Parks-Recreation/Activities-Programs/Outdoor-Recreation#section-9) and [Winter Park](https://www.winterparkresort.com/)'s Galloping Goose lift (both are free). Winter Park doesn't advertise that Galloping Goose is a free lift for beginners, but I have confirmed it myself as of the 2022-2023 season that it still is (although I've heard [it can change from year-to-year](https://www.reddit.com/r/COsnow/comments/tcpe14/do_any_of_the_resorts_let_you_use_the/i0ev93g/?context=10000)). View my post ["The Best Places to Ski in Colorado without a Season Pass"](/posts/the-best-places-to-ski-in-colorado-without-a-season-pass) for additional information.

If you have an [Epic](https://www.epicpass.com/) or [Ikon](https://www.ikonpass.com/) pass, you probably already have a plan of where you're going. If you want to go to one of those resorts, your options will either be a season pass or a (multi) day pass. Season passes are only sold until ~November. Season passes are $500-$1200 depending on when you buy them (cheaper the sooner you buy them) and how much access you want (blackout dates on holidays will result in cheaper passes). Day passes go for ~$200 nowadays (ridiculous), with slight discounts for purchasing a multi-day (2, 3, 4+) pass. If you ski with a season pass holder, they can buy you reduced day (buddy/friend) passes but they're still expensive (~$150/day).

If you don't have an Epic or Ikon pass, there are a few resorts left that are still holding out from getting bought out by a conglomerate. Their day passes will be more reasonable. And if you're a beginner shredder, they're a great place to learn. Day tickets at these places are around $100. View my separate post for best resorts without a season pass: ["The Best Places to Ski in Colorado without a Season Pass"](/posts/the-best-places-to-ski-in-colorado-without-a-season-pass)

## Hiking
Unlike skiing, hiking is something to do in Denver and its nearby areas **year-round** (yes, even in the winter). Denver [averages highs nearing 50¬∞F (10¬∞C) in the winter](https://www.google.com/search?q=denver+climate). Combine that with nearly "[300 days of sunshine](https://www.westword.com/news/denvers-claim-of-300-days-of-sunshine-a-year-is-clouded-10565181)" and winter hiking can be very enjoyable!

AllTrails ([Apple App Store](https://alltrails.io/ujRkr9MGmgb), [Google Play Store](https://alltrails.io/pW7o6i6Lmgb)) is the *de facto* app for finding places to hike and recording your hiking activities. I highly recommend it for any prospective hikers, no matter where you live.

If you are in shape and active, you can do most AllTrails hikes rated as "hard" (Ex. I would not take any normal parents above 50 years old on this hike but any college student that plays intramural sports should be fine). I believe anyone that can go for a 3mi (5km) walk can do an "easy" hike. The "moderate" hikes are somewhere in between the two üòú

The best thing about AllTrails is their ratings and information about hikes. [This](https://www.alltrails.com/us/colorado) is a link to their most highly ranked hikes in Colorado (I have done half of them and can confirm). [This](https://www.alltrails.com/us/colorado/denver) is a link to their best hikes in Denver (more like walks in the park). Search for the area you are staying in or what is near you and go from there.

If you're big into hiking, Colorado has [over 50 peaks](https://thenextsummit.org/how-many-fourteeners-are-in-colorado/) that are above 14,000ft (4,267m). These are known as "14ers". There are no easy 14ers. Even the "easier" ones are multi-hour hikes, 5+mi round trip, rapidly changing weather conditions (normal to have thunderstorms in the afternoon that pushes the astute mountaineerer to start around sunrise and finish around noon), and noticeably less oxygen at the top than the bottom. Do your research before attempting to summit [one of these](https://www.alltrails.com/lists/14ers-in-colorado).

Here are some of my favorite hikes (ordered for proximity to Denver with closest at the top of the list):

<!-- TODO: Make this its own page -->

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Click to show some of my favorite hikes ‚ùóÔ∏è</summary>

  * [Washington Park](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/washington-park-loop)
    * 2.3mi easy paved loop 15min from Denver
    * An easy walk in Denver's best park (my opinion)
    * Also has a gravel running/jogging trail, paved loop for bicycling/roller blading.
    * Plenty of geese and people playing volleyball and enjoying time with friends here
    * Very popular but lots of space
  * Any of [Denver's parks](https://www.denvergov.org/Maps/map/parks): [Cheeseman Park](https://goo.gl/maps/nG1USDFBEcvxsbs89), [City Park](https://goo.gl/maps/VebCHKPurRsRUy1RA), [Sloan's Lake](https://goo.gl/maps/Ts7cbvkqqPASh8zv9), etc.
  * [Red Rocks Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/red-rocks-trading-post-trail)
    * 1.5mi moderate dirt hike 25min from Denver
    * I have never actually done this hike but Red Rocks is gorgeous and while you're there you can even walk over to the stadium to check it out as well
  * [South Table Mountain](https://www.strava.com/activities/5988975770)
    * 2.6mi moderate dirt hike located in Golden, CO (20min from Denver)
    * Fantastic views of Golden, Colorado School of Mines, and Coors Brewing
      * Especially during sunset
    * The left trail of the Strava link above is a much more difficult trail that is fairly steep with loose dirt. The right trail is much easier but longer distance.
    * Not on AllTrails due to apparently a part of the trail goes though private land, but I've never seen anyone have an issue
  * [Royal Arch](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/royal-arch-trail)
    * 3.4mi hard hike located in Boulder, CO (35min from Denver)
    * Fantastic views of Boulder
    * Lots of other hikes here, easy to make a wrong turn
    * Very popular
    * My go-to that I show friends that are visiting
  * [Mount Sanitas](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/mount-sanitas-and-sanitas-valley-loop-trail)
    * 3.2mi hard hike located in Boulder, CO (35min from Denver)
    * I think it is easier than Royal Arch
    * Not as crowded as Royal Arch
  * [Lake Isabelle](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/lake-isabelle-via-pawnee-pass-trail--2)
    * 6.6mi moderate hike located in 30min west of Boulder, CO (1hr 15min from Denver)
    * Fantastic scenery in the mountains
    * Limited to no cell service. Download maps beforehand
    * [Reservation needed](https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10087515/ticket/10087517) for parking. Cheap but difficult to get as they are in high demand
    * Will first hit [Long Lake](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/long-lake-trail) on the way to Lake Isabelle, so you could also not continue to Lake Isabelle and just see Long Lake then turn around for a shorter hike
    * Or, you can continue past Lake Isabelle to [Isabelle Glacier](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/isabelle-glacier-trail-full-loop) to turn this into a long and hard hike.
    * Chance to see Moose (I am 2/3)
